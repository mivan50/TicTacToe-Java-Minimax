# Tic Tac Toe with Minimax Algorithm

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game - the computer player utilizes the Minimax algorithm to determine its moves. This repository contains the source code for the game implemented in Java.

## Features

- Player vs Computer gameplay
- Computer AI based on the Minimax algorithm
- Simple and intuitive command-line interface

## Requirements

- Java

## Usage

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mivan50/TicTacToe-Java-Minimax.git
```

## How Minimax Works

The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm commonly used in two-player turn-based games. In the context of Tic Tac Toe, it works by recursively evaluating all possible future moves and choosing the move that maximizes the computer's chance of winning or minimizing the player's chance of winning.
